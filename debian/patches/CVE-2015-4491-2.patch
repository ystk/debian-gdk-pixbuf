Subject: [PATCH] pixops: Fix oversight for CVE-2015-4491

The n_x variable could be made large enough to overflow, too.

Also included are various testcases for this vulnerability:
- The original exploit (adapted for the testsuite)
- Causing overflow by making both X and Y variables large
- Causing overflow using only the X variable
- Causing overflow using only the Y variable
